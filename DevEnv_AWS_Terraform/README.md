# Create a Development Environment on AWS using Terraform :)

- `HashiCorp Terraform` is an `infrastructure as a code` tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like computing, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

# About this project

- Creating a development environment on AWS using Terraform is a powerful approach that allows developers to provision and manage infrastructure as code. By leveraging the capabilities of Terraform and AWS, developers can easily spin up and configure resources required for their development work, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across environments. Let's explore the steps involved in setting up a development environment on AWS using Terraform.
1. Prerequisites:
   - An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
   - Terraform installed on your local machine.

2. Configure AWS Credentials:
   - Obtain your AWS `access key` ID and `secret access key` from the AWS Management Console.
   - Set up your AWS credentials either by exporting environment variables or using `AWS CLI`'s `aws configure` command.

3. Initialize Terraform:
   - Create a new directory for your Terraform project.
   - Open a terminal in the project directory and run `terraform init`.
   - This command initializes the Terraform project and downloads the necessary provider plugins.

4. Write Terraform Configuration:
   - Create a new file, typically named `main.tf`, and define your desired AWS resources.
   - For a development environment, you might provision resources like virtual machines (EC2 instances), virtual networks (VPC) or other necessary services.
   - Specify resource details such as instance types, network configurations, security groups, and any other required parameters.

5. Create the Development Environment:
   - Run `terraform plan` to see a preview of the changes Terraform will make.
   - Review the plan to ensure it aligns with your expectations.
   - Execute `terraform apply` to create the development environment on AWS.
   - Terraform will prompt for confirmation before making any changes.
   - Type `yes` to proceed, and Terraform will provision the specified resources.

6. Access and Configure the Environment:
   - Once the provisioning process completes, Terraform will display the `output variables` defined in your configuration file.
   - These outputs might include the IP addresses, access keys, or other important details required to connect to your development environment.
   - Make note of these outputs and use them to access and configure your development environment accordingly.

7. Managing the Environment:
   - To make changes to your development environment, modify your Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`) as needed.
   - Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes and `terraform apply` to apply them.
   - Terraform will automatically determine the delta between the desired and existing state and apply the necessary updates.
   
8. Destroying the Environment:
   - When you no longer need the development environment, you can use Terraform to clean up the provisioned resources.
   - Run `terraform destroy` to destroy all the resources created by Terraform.
   - Confirm the destruction by typing `yes` when prompted.

- By following these steps, you can easily `create and manage a development environment on AWS using Terraform`. This approach enables `infrastructure-as-code` practices, ensures consistency across environments, and allows for easy reproducibility and scalability of your development setup.
